1. Open a terminal in the project root directory.
2. Run the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Once the server is listening on http://localhost:5173, open Chrome to view the app:
   ```
   start chrome http://localhost:5173
   ```
4. The server will keep running; stop it with Ctrl+C when you are done.
