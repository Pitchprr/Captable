1. Open a terminal in the project root directory.
2. Run the development server:
   // turbo
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Once the server is running (listening on http://localhost:5173), open Chrome to view the app:
   // turbo
   ```
   start chrome http://localhost:5173
   ```
4. The server will continue running; you can stop it with Ctrl+C when done.
